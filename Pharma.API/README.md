# Vitura | Senior .NET Assessment - Q1 2025

## Overview
Build a single API endpoint that lists pharmacy orders with filtering, sorting, pagination and one business rule. The solution should reflect standard ASP.NET Core practices with controllers, models and DTOs. Use async throughout. Keep setup minimal and focus on senior-level judgement.

Timebox: Aim for under three hours. Stop at three hours and note what remains.

## What You Will Build
- .NET 8 Web API with one endpoint: `GET /orders`
- Orders loaded from `sample-orders.json` into memory at startup (no database)

## Dataset
Use the provided [`sample-orders.json`](https://github.com/mjkearns/vitura-senior-dotnet-assesment-08-2025/blob/main/sample-orders.json) with 1,000 realistic orders across 50 pharmacies. Load it in memory at startup. Do not add a database.

## Functional Requirements
- **Endpoint:** `GET /orders`
- **Structure:**
  - Use a controller (`OrdersController`)
  - Create a model (`Order`) that maps the dataset
  - Create a DTO (`OrderResponseDto`) for the API response
  - Implement the endpoint as async and support cancellation
- **Query parameters:**
  - `pharmacyId` string, optional
  - `status` repeatable, optional (eg: `status=Pending&status=Shipped`)
  - `from` and `to` ISO dates, optional
  - `sort` in `{createdAt,totalCents}`, default `createdAt`
  - `dir` in `{asc,desc}`, default `desc`
  - `page` integer, default `1`
  - `pageSize` integer, default `20`, max `100`
- **Response shape:**
  - `items` array of orders
  - `page`, `pageSize`, `total`
- **Business rule:**
  - If an order's `totalCents` is greater than a configurable daily threshold, include `needsReview: true` on that item
  - Threshold set by config key `Review:DailyOrderThresholdCents`

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Validation**
  - Validate query parameters and return a useful error for bad input
  - Enforce `pageSize` maximum 100
- **Default behaviour**
  - Default sort is `createdAt desc`
  - Pagination should be stable under repeated calls with the same parameters
- **Observability**
  - Log one structured line per request with correlation ID, validated params, elapsed ms and item count
  - Include error logs for validation failures
- **Performance thinking**
  - Stay in memory for this exercise
  - In your README describe the indexes/query approach you would use in production and how you would test it

## Testing
Provide two focused unit tests:
1. `needsReview` flag is applied correctly using config threshold
2. Pagination returns stable results across repeated calls

## Deliverables
A **GitHub repo** that contains:
- .NET 8 Web API project with controllers, models, and DTOs
- Async implementation with cancellation support
- `sample-orders.json` loaded at startup
- Unit tests as above
- **README** that covers:
  - How to run locally
  - Indexing/query approach you would use in production
  - Trade-offs made due to time limit and what you would do next

## What To Ignore
- Authentication/authorisation
- Full repository or DAL patterns
- Database setup
- Complex DI configuration beyond basics

## Evaluation Rubric (0-4 each, total 20)
- **Correctness** - spec met and edge cases handled
- **Code quality** - clear structure, naming, cohesion
- **Tests** - targeted, easy to run
- **Senior judgement** - defaults, trade-offs, ops thinking
- **Developer experience** - README clarity, simple startup, useful logs

## Getting Started
- Use controllers, models, and DTOs to reflect standard ASP.NET Core practices
- Use async and support cancellation
- Use `System.Text.Json`
- Generate a correlation ID per request (or accept `x-correlation-id`) and log it
